# Bob's Advent of Code 2022

It's Advent of Code time again! I probably won't document every day like I did [last year](https://github.com/mrdrbob/aoc-2021), but may write up some stuff as I get into the chunkier puzzles.

Everything is in C# again this year. I have no intention of keeping up with this every day, but may try to at least beat all the puzzles... eventually.
